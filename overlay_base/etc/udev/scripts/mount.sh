# Attempt to mount any added block devices and umount any removed devices

# By default we boot from a block device the BSP uses the first partition to
# store the files used by U-Boot, aka. the bootfs. The second partition of the
# same block device then contains the rootfs.
# Read the PARTUUID of the rootfs from /proc/cmdline, check if that device
# exists and then assume that the first partition on that device is the one
# with the bootpartion on it.
# Symlink that partition to /dev/boot-part, that then gets mounted to /boot,
# compare with /etc/fstab.
